This repository was created to list some popular algorithms, include tutorials, study materials and contain some implementations, to help students prepare for competitive coding events like ACM ICPC and also for placements. This website contains tutorials for various algorithms and for the corresponding implementation you can check out the repository [Algorithms](https://github.com/codeIIEST/Algorithms) under our [Github Organization](https://github.com/codeIIEST).

Also, this repository is currently growing, and we want this to always grow, including more and more algorithm implementations. So, you are free to contribute your implementations, making sure they are well documented for the reader to understand.

Happy Coding!
